# Niche Loops

...also known as "Way too Niche and Peculiar but Actually Necessary Loop Tools", is an add-on that includes a few interresting loop tools.

A friend asked me to recreate a few nice features from 3dsmax in Blender, and so I did.

## Operators

As of now, this addon contains the following operators:

- Build End
- Build Corner
- Adjust Loops
- Adjust Adjacent Loops

### Build End

A complete explanation and example will come soon...

### Build Corner

### Adjust Loops

### Adjust Adjacent Loops

## TODO

Here is a list of things I plan on adding in the future:

**Interactiveness**

For the two Adjust Loops operators, I want to implement a drag-to-adjust feature like you have when extruding or sliding an edge.

## Contributing

Any contributions, bug fixes, or simply bug reports are well appriciated !
Feel free to create a issue on Github for feature requests too, but please keep them about the existing operators for now.

If you would like me to developp an addon for you (paid work), feel free to get in touch by email twinkelmann(at)pm.me, or on Discord twinkelmann#6921
